### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because I have always been curious about computers and coding.
    When I was younger I alwyas  wanted to get into coding to make a videogame.
    I was able to write code that outputed the message Hello World onto the screen using code.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because We coded a line of code that solved a math equation. The code would create 
    an object to recive the answer, an equation that the computer would solve and then output an answer.
    I wrote code that created an object, an equation and a output which showed the answer to the equation.
    
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because we used the object double.
    Using double allowed the object to carry a more specific value.
    Using double to figure out how much a pizza cost per square inch.
