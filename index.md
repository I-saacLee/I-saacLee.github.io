### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because I have always been curious about computers and coding.
    When I was younger I always wanted to get into coding to make a videogame.
    I was able to write code that output the message "Hello World" onto the screen using code.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because we coded a line of code that solved a viral internet math equation.
    The code would create an object to hold the answer, an equation that the computer would solve and then output the answer.
    I wrote code that created an object, an equation, and an output which showed the answer to the equation.
    
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because we used double to figure out the cost of pizza.
    Using double allowed the type to carry a more specific value such as decimals.
    Using doubles, we figured out how much certain pizzas cost per square inch.
